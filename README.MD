Q&A
1.) Was the question/problem clear? 
    Yes I think the question was clear.
    
2.) Did you feel like something was missing or not explained correctly?
    No.

3.) How much time did you spend on each part :understanding,designing,coding,testing? 
    I can't tell you the extact time for each part however, I spend 65% of my time coding and 35% of understanding, designing and        
    testing. 

4.) What would you have done differently if you had more time or resources?
    If I had more time I would have done a couples things differently. First I would have implemented React on the front end but I 
    didn't have that much time becuase I was trying to complete other assignments from different companies. 
    Secondly, my frontend would have look alot more sophisticated. Third and most importantly, I would have install Windows Pro or 
    Enterprise so I can use Docker. I have Windows Home instead. 
    
5.) Anything else you want to share about your solution or the problem?
    I really enjoy the assingment.
